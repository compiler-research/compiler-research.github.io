### Introduction

I’m Chaitanya Shahare, a passionate full-stack web developer and a pre-final-year
Mechanical Engineering student at the National Institute of Technology
Srinagar, India. This summer, I'm delighted to embark on an exciting journey with LLVM as
Google Summer of Code 2024 contributor, where I'll be contributing to the LLVM project by
improving the look and feel of its central hub, the LLVM.org website.

**Mentors**: Tanya Lattner and Vassil Vassilev

### Why I Chose LLVM.org

My fascination with coding and web development is about
making a real impact. LLVM.org is not just a website; it's a vital resource for
developers, researchers, and enthusiasts involved in the LLVM project. The site
provides crucial information, updates, and tools needed by the LLVM community
to thrive. Over time, the website has grown organically, which now calls for a
systematic redesign to enhance its functionality and aesthetic appeal. My
project focuses on making LLVM.org more modern, navigable, and user-friendly,
ensuring it continues to serve as a robust platform supporting innovation in
compiler technology.

### My Personal Drive

My journey in technology has always been driven by a simple principle: use what
you learn to make things better for others. Working on LLVM.org allows me to
apply everything I've learned about web development to improve a tool that
thousands of people rely on. My previous internships and personal projects
involving website management have prepared me well for this task, and I'm eager
to see how much of a difference I can make.

### A Closer Look at the Project

Starting this journey to revamp the LLVM.org website, my mission is to
transform it into a hub that not only serves its purpose efficiently but also
delights its users with its simplicity and elegance. Here’s a step-by-step
breakdown of how I plan to achieve this:

1. **Comprehensive Content Audit**: The first order of business is to dive deep
   into the current content of the LLVM.org website. This involves evaluating
   each page to determine its relevance and usefulness. A significant focus
   will be on enhancing the site's navigation to ensure that it is intuitive
   and user-friendly. This audit will help us identify any outdated
   information, redundant pages, or missing pieces that are crucial for users.
   This step will involve working closely with the LLVM community through
   feedback, surveys, and discussions.

2. **Selecting the Right Building Blocks**: For the technical platform, I’ll be
   using Hugo, a powerful tool known for building fast and reliable websites.
   Hugo is not only quick but also makes managing content straightforward,
   which is essential for a website like LLVM.org that is frequently updated
   with new information. This choice ensures that the website can be easily
   maintained and updated by the community, long after the project's
   completion also ensuring that this project is reusable for other sub-projects
   websites in the LLVM ecosystem.

3. **Interactive Design Process**: Designing an engaging and user-friendly
   website is not a solo task. I plan to create several design prototypes, each
   offering a different look and feel. These prototypes will be shared with the
   LLVM community through surveys and discussion forums to gather feedback.
   It's crucial that the community's voice is heard in this process, as they
   are the primary users of the site. This collaborative approach ensures that
   the final design is not only visually appealing but also functionally
   tailored to the needs of its users.

4. **Building the Site**: With a design selected and technology ready, the next
   phase is the actual site development. This involves coding the website,
   setting up the structure for content, and integrating all the visual
   elements. During this phase, I’ll ensure that the site is responsive,
   meaning it’ll work seamlessly on both desktops and mobile devices, and
   accessible, ensuring that users with disabilities can also use it
   comfortably.

5. **Rigorous Testing and Feedback Loop**: Before the new site goes live,
   extensive testing is essential. This will include checking that all links
   work, the site loads quickly on different devices, and there are no
   accessibility barriers. Feedback from the community will be crucial during
   this phase to catch any issues and ensure that the site meets everyone’s
   needs.

Through detailed planning, collaborative design, and careful execution, this
project aims to not only revamp the LLVM.org website but also enhance how the
LLVM community interacts with it.

### Conclusion

As we start this journey to improve the LLVM.org website, I am excited and
ready for the challenges ahead. I'm confident we can create a website that
everyone will find easy to use and helpful.
