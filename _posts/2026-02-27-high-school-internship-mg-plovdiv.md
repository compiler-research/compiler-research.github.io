I'm excited to announce a new internship program we're running with the High
School of Mathematics "Akademik Kiril Popov" in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. After the Compiler
Research Group's deep technical work in 2024 — advances in Clad and CppInterOp,
tighter integration with ROOT and CUDA, and the growth of a genuinely global
open-source community — it felt natural to open the door wider and invite
motivated high-school students to join us.

This program is for 10th-grade students who want an honest, hands-on
introduction to low-level compiler and systems engineering. Our goal is simple
and direct: move students from curiosity to contribution. We'll give them the
tools, structure, and mentorship they need to make real, upstreamed changes in
open-source projects.

What students will learn:
* Practical version control and collaboration: Git, GitHub workflows, code
  review etiquette, and Software Carpentry best practices.
* Technical communication: writing concise technical proposals and documenting
  work so others can build on it.
* Systems and compiler work: WebAssembly and xeus-cpp tutorial development,
  understanding compilation pipelines, and small tooling projects.
* Accelerated GPU exposure: foundations of CUDA and how to reason about
  performance and correctness on GPUs.
* Open-source contribution: preparing patches, working with maintainers, and
  upstreaming changes to projects like CppInterOp.
* Project work: building agent-based simulations in Python, pairing with
  mentors, and delivering a short public tutorial or demo.

Students often learn concepts in school but rarely see how those concepts
translate into engineered systems or community impact. That gap is what we want
to close. From my perspective, the most valuable outcomes are not just polished
code or a CV line — they are the habits: clear writing, iterative design,
collaboration across timezones, and the discipline to follow an idea through to
a merged contribution.

Our group knows that small, well-mentored tasks lead to early wins: interns gain
confidence, maintainers gain useful patches, and the whole project benefits.
This program formalizes that pattern and creates a repeatable path for new
contributors.

With enough motivation and perserverance they will make their first impactful
open source contributions very soon!
