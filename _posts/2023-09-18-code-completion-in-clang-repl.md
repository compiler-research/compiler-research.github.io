### Overview of the Project

Clang-Repl, featuring a REPL(Read-Eval-Print-Loop) environment, allows
developers to program in C++ interactively. It is a C++ interpreter built upon
the Clang and LLVM incremental compilation pipeline. One of the missing upstream
features in Clang-Repl is the ability to propose options for automatically
completing user input or code completion. Sometimes, C++ can be quite wordy,
requiring users to type every character of an expression or
statement. Consequently, this causes typos or syntactic errors. For example,

```
clang-repl> class HelloMyFirstClassThatHasAReallyLongName{}
clang-repl> new H<cursor>
```

Currenctly, users need to type all the rest of thirty-eight letters. However,
armed with a code completion system, users will be able to either complete the
input if there is only one completion result or see a list of valid completion
candidates. Furthermore, the code completion should be context-aware, and it
should provide semantically relevant results with respect to the current
position and the input on the current line, as opposed to showing all the
symbols in the current namespace. The problem is demonstrated by the example below

```
clang-repl> struct Vehicle{};
clang-repl> struct Car : Vehicle{};
clang-repl> struct Sedan : Car{};
clang-repl> void moveCar(Car &c){};
clang-repl> Vehicle v;
clang-repl> Car c1, c2;
clang-repl> Sedan s;
clang-repl> c.move(<tab>
```

If users hit the `<tab`> key at the indicated position, listing all symbols
would be distracting. It is easy to find out that among all declarations, only
`c1`, `c2` and `s` are well-typed candidates. So an ideal code completion system
should be able to filter out results using type information.

The project leverages existing components of Clang/LLVM and aims to provides
context-aware semantic completion suggestions.

### My Approach

The project mainly consists of two patches. The first patch involves building
syntactic code completion based on Clang/LLVM infrastruture. The second patch
goes one step further by implementing type directed code completion.

**Pull Request** : [D154382](https://reviews.llvm.org/D154382)

#### Highlights

1. In the submitted patch, we have multiple iterations to integrate the new
components with the existing infrastructure while not reinventing the wheel. For
each code completion, we create a special AST unit called `ASTUnit` with the
current input and invoke its method `ASTUnit::codeComplete` with a completion
point to do the heavy-lifting job.

2. `Sema/CodeComplete*` are a collection of modules in Clang that play an
central role in code completion. We added new completion contexts so the
`Sema/CodeComplete*` can provide correct completion results for the new
declaration kind that Clang-Repl uses model statements on the global scope. The
underlying reason is that in a regular C++ file, expression statements are not
allowed to appear at the top level. Therefore, `Sema/CodeComplete*` would
exclude invalid completion candidates for expression statements, which are
nonetheless common inputs at the REPL.

3. `Sema/CodeComplete*` assume the input is an intact source file or AST context
by default.  Because a new compiler instance is created whenever code completion
is triggered, `Sema/CodeComplete*` would not be able to see all declarations
defined by previous inputs in the same REPL session. The solution is to
construct an `ExternalASTSource` with `ASTContext`s from both the code
completion and main compiler instances, and use that `ExternalASTSource` as the
external source of the code completion's `ASTContext`. Code completion invokes
`ExternalASTSource::completeVisibleDeclsMap`, where we import decls from the
main `ASTContext` to the code completion `ASTContext`.

### Future Work

**Pull Request** : [D159128](https://reviews.llvm.org/D159128)

The type-directed code completion is still a work in progress. It was developed
based on an early version of the patch submitted. With this feature, code
completion results are further narrowed down to well-typed candidates with
respect to completion points. Here is a screecast:

### Conclusion & Acknowledgments

The journey has been incredibly thrilling. I have honed my C++ skills and delved
into Clang/LLVM with a focus on interactions of components responsible for
parsing. Thanks to everything I learned from the project, I feel confident in
becoming a better Clang/LLVM contributor and compiler hacker.

Last but not the least, I would like to express gratitude to my mentor Vassil
for his many valuable discussions and feedback regarding the patch. His guidance
ensured the project procceeded smoothly. Without him, I would have not been able
to complete the project in a timely manner.
