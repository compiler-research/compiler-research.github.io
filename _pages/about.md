<b>Purpose</b> Our purpose is to establish a dynamic and collaborative hub,
bringing together researchers, practitioners, and educators united by their
enthusiasm for foundational software tools. We aim to catalyze transformative
advancements in scientific computing, fostering a community that thrives on
shared knowledge and innovation.

<b>Mission</b> At the heart of our mission is the commitment to foster
innovation and excellence at the intersection of compiler research and data
science. We strive to create a vibrant community that not only facilitates the
exchange of ideas but also champions interdisciplinary research. Our ultimate
goal is to inspire the next generation of compiler engineers and researchers,
contributing to the continuous evolution of these fields.

<b>Vision</b> We envision a world where individuals can leverage efficient,
data-driven solutions to address complex problems in a scalable and reproducible
manner. Our focus on providing advanced scientific infrastructure aims to push
the boundaries of data analysis, benefiting both scientific and industrial
contexts. Through collaboration, we seek to engage researchers across various
domains, envisioning a future where data-driven solutions play a pivotal role
in addressing global challenges.

By focusing on interpretative C/C++/CUDA, automatic differentiation tools, and C++ language interoperability with Python, our goal is to revolutionize scientific software development and contribute to the evolution of programming languages.
