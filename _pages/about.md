<b>Purpose</b> Our purpose is to establish a dynamic and collaborative hub,
bringing together researchers, practitioners, and educators united by their
enthusiasm for foundational software tools. 

<b>Mission</b> We strive to create a vibrant community that not only facilitates the
exchange of ideas but also champions interdisciplinary research. Our ultimate
goal is to inspire the next generation of compiler engineers and researchers,
contributing to the continuous evolution of these fields.

<b>Vision</b> We envision a world where individuals can leverage efficient,
data-driven solutions to address complex problems in a scalable and reproducible
manner. Our focus on providing advanced scientific infrastructure aims to push
the boundaries of data analysis, benefiting both scientific and industrial
contexts. Through collaboration, we seek to engage researchers across various
domains, envisioning a future where data-driven solutions play a pivotal role
in addressing global challenges.

We believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge-sharing.
Compiler-research.org provides a platform where researchers from Princeton
University and CERN, as well as contributors from around the world, can come
together to exchange ideas, share insights, and engage in interdisciplinary
collaborations. 

By focusing on interpretative C/C++/CUDA, automatic differentiation tools, and
C++ language interoperability with Python, our goal is to revolutionize
scientific software development and contribute to the evolution of programming
languages.
