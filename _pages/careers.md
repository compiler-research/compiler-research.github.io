# Candidate Guidelines

If you have interest in working on the project there is a list of things to do in order to maximize your chances to get selected:

1. Contact the mentors and express interest in the project. Make sure you attach your CV;
2. Download the source code of the project, build it and run the demos;
3. Start familiarizing yourself with the codebase;
4. If you have questions you can always contact a mentor.

## Candidate Evaluation

The mentors are interested in working with all candidates but unfortunately not everyone can be selected. There are a few tasks which give bonus points to candidate's application:

- Submit a valid bug -- demonstrates that the candidate has completed step 2 and 3 from the previous section.
- Fix a bug -- demonstrates the technical skills of the candidate and shows he/she can work independently on the project. The mentors can suggest looking into these good first issues. Fixing one issue may be enough to become a successful candidate.

## What not to do and will give you negative points

1. Contact the mentors with very generic requests such as "Please guide me through the X". You need to show that you have spent time on the problem. Such emails prove otherwise.
2. Contact each mentor individually. You should use "reply-all" feature of your email and discuss openly with your prospective mentors the project.
3. Send the same email to express interest on multiple projects. If you do not invest time to write separate emails for the different projects why the mentors should?
4. Comment under opened issues with generic requests as described in 1. You need to show that you can work on bugs and use bug trackers. That shows the opposite.
5. Use LLM-generated content. You should prove to yourself that project is appropriate for you otherwise we will hire the LLM instead of you.
6. If any of the criteria is met to some degree mentors are free to tell you so or even not respond to your requests. We understand that may seem harsh, however, you should appreciate other's time at least as much as they appreciate yours!

Good luck!
