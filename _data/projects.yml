- name: "Clad - an Automatic Differentiation Tool"
  description: |
    Clad is a plugin for the Clang compiler that enables automatic differentiation
    capabilities for C/C++ codebases. It is a valuable tool for developers seeking
    to streamline complex mathematical computations and optimize their codebase
    efficiently.

    Clad facilitates the generation of derivatives, gradients, Hessians, and
    Jacobians (in forward and/or reverse mode), enhancing the efficiency and
    versatility of numerical computations.

    Clad not only supports partial and higher-order derivatives but also
    integrates seamlessly with frameworks like ROOT, providing a comprehensive
    solution for automatic differentiation needs in C++ applications.

- name: "Xeus-CPP - a Jupyter Kernel for C++"
  description: |
    Xeus-CPP is a product of OAC-1931408 in collaboration with the QuantStack
    company. It is a Jupyter kernel for C++ based on the native implementation
    of the Jupyter protocol xeus. It is supports the Wasm version of Jupyter
    (JupyterLite). It is a generalization of the Xeus-Clang-Repl (a Jupyter
    plugin supporting C++ development based on ClangRepl).

    With Xeus-CPP, you can write and execute C++ code interactively, seeing
    the results immediately. This REPL nature allows you to iterate quickly
    without the overhead of compiling and running separate C++ programs.

- name: "Clang-REPL - an Interactive C++ Interpreter"
  description: |
    Clang-Repl is an interactive C++ interpreter that allows for incremental
    compilation. It supports interactive programming for C++ in a
    read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) style.

    Clang-Repl is suitable for exploratory programming and in places where
    time to insight is important. Clang-Repl is a project inspired by the work
    in Cling, a LLVM-based C/C++ interpreter developed by the field of high
    energy physics and used by the scientific data analysis framework ROOT.
    Clang-Repl allows to move parts of Cling upstream, making them useful and
    available to a broader audience.

- name: "CppInterOp - a C++ Language Interoperability Layer"
  description: |
    CppInterOp (previously LibInterOp) is a product of OAC-1931408 and exposes
    APIs from Clang and LLVM in a mostly backward compatibe way. The APIs
    support downstream tools that utilize interactive C++ by using the
    compiler as a service. That is, embed Clang and LLVM as a libraries in
    their codebases. 
    
    The APIs are designed to be minimalistic and aid non-trivial tasks such as
    language interoperability on the fly. In such scenarios CppInterOp can be
    used to provide the necessary introspection information to the other side
    helping the language cross talk. The package makes it easy to deploy as it
    ships Clang as a service without any dependencies.

- name: "Cling - an Interactive C++ Interpreter"
  description: |
    Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter that operates on top of the Clang and
    LLVM libraries, utilizing LLVM's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for fast and
    optimized compilation processes. 

    By adopting a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) approach, Cling is helping C++
    development evolve by enabling rapid application development without the need
    for the traditional edit-compile-run-debug cycle, thus facilitating quick
    prototyping and exploration in C++.

    By providing support for advanced C++ features like templates, lambdas, and
    virtual inheritance, Cling empowers developers in exploratory programming with
    interactive, dynamic language interoperability and rapid prototyping.
