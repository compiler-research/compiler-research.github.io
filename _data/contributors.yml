  - title: "Powering cppyy with CppInterOp, and interactive C++ technologies in Clang and LLVM"
    status: Completed
    description: |
      Developing CppInterOp, an interoperability library between Python and C++
      based on the interactive C++ technologies available in Clang and LLVM.
      This involves modernizing cppyy, to use upstream LLVM's Clang-REPL component
      as a runtime compiler. We also explore the added performance gain due to fewer
      dependencies, faster lookups as well as the expanded feature set that can be
      made available to Cppyy users on schedule with upstream Clang-REPL releases.
      The project aims to stabilize CppInterop with Clang-REPL and Cling, as well
      as develop its capabilities with template instantiation and lookups. Another
      aspect is exploring the optimizations of the current Python-C++ interoperability
      framework utilizing Numba. Numba allows Python users to Just-In-Time compile
      subsets of mixed Python-C++ code into machine code which can significantly accelerate
      codebases that use cppyy. Current research aims to expand capabilities to enable
      users to leverage CUDA C++ code in Python and subsequently utilize Numba for its
      JIT compilation.

  - title: "Extending the Numba support in cppyy"
    status: Completed
    description: |
      Numba is a JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine
      code. Cppyy is an automatic, run-time, Python-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from
      Python and Python from C++.
      Cppyy has to pay a time penalty each time it needs to switch between languages which can
      multiply into large slowdowns when using loops with cppyy objects. This is where Numba can
      help. Since Numba compiles the code in loops into machine code it only has to cross the
      language barrier once and the loops thus run faster.
      Initial support for Cppyy objects in Numba enabled the use of builtin types and classes, but
      some essential C++ features, such as references and STL classes, are not yet supported.
      The project aims to add support for C++ reference types in Numba through Cppyy and improve
      the existing numba extension implementation to provide general support for C++ templates.
      This added support will allow cppyy users to define a wider array of standard and templated
      functions that can leverage reference types to the C++ code defined in python.

    - title: "Improve automatic differentiation of object-oriented paradigms using Clad"
      status: Ongoing
      description: |
        Clad is a Clang plugin enabling automatic differentiation (AD) for C++ mathematical
        functions by modifying the abstract syntax tree using LLVM's compiler capabilities.
        It integrates into existing codebases without modifications and supports forward and
        reverse mode differentiation. Reverse mode is efficient for Machine Learning and
        inverse problems involving backpropagation.
        Reverse mode AD requires two passes: forward pass stores intermediate values, reverse
        pass computes derivatives. Currently, Clad only supports storing trivially copyable
        types for function call arguments, limiting support for C-style arrays and non-copyable
        types like unique pointers, constraining Object-Oriented Programming usage.
        The project aims to enhance Clad's capability to store intermediate values for non-copyable
        types. One of the challenges lies in determining which expressions are modified in nested
        functions, potentially requiring run-time memory location tracking, which can be inefficient.
        The solution involves enhancing To-Be-Recorded (TBR) analysis, currently limited with
        poor nested function call support and no pointer reassignment handling. Improved TBR
        analysis will enable predictable memory handling, generating optimal code, and
        supporting both non-copyable types and efficient storage of copyable structures.

    - title: "Optimizing reverse-mode automatic differentiation with advanced activity-analysis"
      status: Completed project
      description: |
        Clad is an automatic differentiation clang plugin for C++. It automatically
        generates code that computes derivatives of functions given by the user.
        Clad can work in two main modes: forward and reverse. The reverse mode involves
        computing the derivative by applying the chain rule to all the elementary operations
        from the result to the argument. It turns out to be more
        efficient when there are more dependent output variables than independent
        input variables (e.g. calculating a gradient). However, the approach to blindly
        compute the derivatives of all the intermediate variables obviously produces
        code that does a lot of unnecessary calculations. With advanced activity analysis,
        the variables which are not used to compute the result can be found and removed,
        increasing the time- and memory- efficiency of the output code.

      description: |
        Clad is a Clang plugin designed to provide automatic differentiation (AD) for C++ mathematical functions. It generates code for computing derivatives modifying Abstract-Syntax-Tree(AST) using LLVM compiler features. It performs advanced program optimization by implementing more sophisticated analyses because it has access to a rich program representation – the Clang AST. Clad supports reverse-mode differentiation of the CUDA kernels, however it is not always optimal because the generated code might contain the data-race conditions, significantly slowing up the execution. Thread Safety Analysis is a static analysis that detects possible data-race conditions that would enable reducing atomic operations in the Clad-produced code.

    - title: "Optimizing automatic differentiation using activity analysis"
      status: Completed project
      description: |
        Clad has undergone significant optimization in the recent years. One such optimization is the To-Be-Recorded optimization which reduces the memory pressure to the clad tape data structure. The next step is to implement the activity analysis which discards all statements which are irrelevant for the generated code. That is, if the statements do not depend on the input/output variables of a routine in a differentiable way, they are ignored. Combining both analyses could result in a much greater performance, which is our ultimate goal.

      status: Ongoing
      description: |
        This project aims to enhance Clang-Repl, an interactive C++ interpreter built
        on top of LLVM’s ORC JIT infrastructure. Currently, Clang-Repl lacks a
        mechanism to automatically load dynamic libraries when encountering unresolved
        symbols. As a result, users must manually load the appropriate libraries if a
        symbol used in their code resides in a specific dynamic library. To address
        this limitation, we propose a solution that enables automatic library loading
        for unresolved symbols. Additionally, the second goal of this project is to
        introduce support for re-optimization within Clang-Repl, allowing code to
        benefit from improved performance through dynamic optimization techniques.

        This project focuses on enhancing Clang-Repl, an interactive C++ interpreter
        that leverages LLVM's JIT infrastructure. The current in-process execution model
        poses challenges, especially for resource-constrained devices and stability.
        By transitioning Clang-Repl to an out-of-process execution model, this project
        aims to address these limitations. It will improve resource efficiency, making
        Clang-Repl usable on devices with limited resources, and enhance crash resilience,
        preventing user code failures from crashing the entire interpreter. This shift will
        foster a more robust and accessible interactive C++ compilation and execution environment.

      status: Ongoing
      description: |
        cppyy is a Python library that provides fully automatic,
        dynamic Python-C++ bindings using the cling based C++ interpreter/incremental compiler.
        Cling itself is based on the LLVM toolchain. Compiler Research maintains its own fork of cppyy.
        The main motivation of this fork is to directly use the LLVM's clang-REPL for C/C++ interpreter/incremental
        compiler. This reduces the burden on the developers to maintain a separate fork of LLVM like the cling
        interpreter. The Compiler Research's cppyy fork's migration to using the upstream clang-REPL is an ongoing
        effort. The migration is incomplete, and many tests fail in the Compiler Research's fork.
        I aim to fix as many failing tests as possible to complete the transition to use the clang-REPL compiler
        backend.<br>
        Once the migration to use the clang-REPL backend is complete, I plan on implementing a multi-language
        Jupyter Kernel on top of xeus-cpp. This multi-language kernel will support using both C++ and Python for code
        execution and will provide the ability for the users to seamlessly use symbols defined in each other.

       variant information extracted directly from sequencing reads using 
       CIGAR strings and MD tags. By storing alignments and variants together
       in a columnar format, researchers can query a genomic region and retrieve
       both read evidence and detected variants in a single operation. This 
       eliminates the need to maintain separate BAM and VCF files and enables
       compression ratios exceeding CRAM 3.1. The system directly supports 
       clinical validation workflows where manual review of aligned 
       reads is essential for confirming variant calls.

       This project aims to advance genomic data management by implementing ROOT's

       with validation of previous GeneROOT benchmarks showing 4x performance gains
       with `TTree`, we will then extend these capabilities with RNTuple technology.
       Genomic sequencing data volumes are growing exponentially, creating performance
       bottlenecks in traditional formats.RNTuple's improved memory mapping, type
       safety through templated interfaces, and parallelization capabilities position
       it as an ideal solution.
       We will systematically compare compression algorithms, implement file splitting
       strategies, and benchmark against established formats.Additionally, I will
       analyze the latest compression strategies implemented by samtools and incorporate
       these techniques into the project to ensure comprehensive coverage of state-of-the-art
       genomic data compression approaches.
       The project will deliver optimized tools for handling rapidly growing genomic datasets,
       potentially establishing a new standard for high-performance genomic data analysis.

      status: Ongoing
      description: |
       The xeus-cpp project provides a Jupyter kernel that enables interactive C++ programming
       in Jupyter notebooks. It allows C++ code to be compiled and executed cell by cell while 
       preserving state across executions, which makes it useful for experimentation and learning, 
       but also introduces behavior that is not always obvious.This project starts with contained, 
       simpler tasks that assume prior C++ experience, rather than beginner-level programming. 
       The initial phase focuses on writing structured C++ programs in xeus-cpp notebooks and observing how they behave when split 
       across multiple cells. These examples are used to explore and explain key aspects of the kernel, 
       such as execution order, state persistence, recompilation, and error handling.
       As the project progresses, the focus shifts toward more advanced usage patterns, including modifying 
       existing code, reusing definitions across cells, and understanding how changes affect previously executed code. 
       The goal is to build a clear mental model of how xeus-cpp works from a users perspective.
       With this foundation, the project then moves to a high-level exploration of the xeus-cpp codebase to understand 
       its overall structure and execution flow. Based on this understanding, the final stage focuses on small, practical 
       contributions such as improving documentation, adding example notebooks, or clarifying existing behavior.

       The project aims to increase speed and efficiency in the GeneRoot project.
       Speed is a crucial part in any research and development environment. With
       the advancement of genomic sequencing technologies the speed of acquisition
       and the size of the data being handled in the field has shown growth by an 
       exceptionally large factor in the last decade. As such GeneRoot and tools
       like it will be used for the analysis of amounts of data far exceeding
       the currently seen ones. Speed may be gained by employing a variety of
       different methods including: faster/more optimal search algorithms, better
       compression/ordering of data without loss of information and exploiting
       the full potential of modern hardware. Some of these methods will be 
       tested and employed in the project.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        CAR T-cell therapy is a form of cancer immunotherapy that engineers a patient’s T cells
        to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. Although highly effective in leukemias and other
        hematological cancers, this therapy faces significant challenges in solid tumors due to the
        complex and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. CARTopiaX is an advanced agent-based model
        developed to address this challenge, using the mathematical framework proposed in the Nature
        paper “In silico study of heterogeneous tumour-derived organoid response to CAR T-cell therapy,”
        successfully replicating its core results. Built on BioDynaMo, a high-performance, open-source
        platform for large-scale and modular biological modeling, CARTopiaX enables detailed
        exploration of complex biological interactions, hypothesis testing, and data-driven discovery
        within solid tumor microenvironments.
        The project achieved major milestones, including simulations that run more than twice as fast as
        previous model, allowing rapid scenario exploration and robust hypothesis validation; high-quality,
        well-structured, and maintainable C++ code developed following modern software engineering
        principles; and a scalable, modular, and extensible architecture that fosters collaboration,
        customization, and the continuous evolution of an open-source ecosystem. Altogether, this work
        represents a meaningful advancement in computational biology, providing researchers with a powerful
        tool to investigate CAR T-cell dynamics in solid tumor and accelerating scientific discovery while
        reducing the time and cost associated with experimental wet-lab research.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        Training Large Language Models is computationally expensive, often
        limited by the performance limitations of Python-based frameworks. This
        project addresses this challenge by enhancing LLM training efficiency
        within a C++ environment through the integration of Clad, a Clang/LLVM
        compiler plugin for automatic differentiation (AD). We will develop a
        custom C++ tensor library specifically designed for optimal interaction
        with Clad. The core objective is to replace traditional runtime or
        manual gradient computations with Clad's efficient compile-time
        differentiation for key LLM operations within a GPT-2 training pipeline.
        This involves investigating effective strategies to bridge Clad's static
        analysis with dynamic neural network computations, benchmarking the
        resulting performance gains in speed and memory usage against a non-Clad
        baseline, and leveraging OpenMP for further parallelization.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a computational technique that enables
        efficient and precise evaluation of derivatives for functions expressed in code.
        Clad is a Clang-based automatic differentiation tool that transforms C++ source
        code to compute derivatives efficiently. A crucial component for AD in Clad is the
        tape, a stack-like data structure that stores intermediate values for reverse mode AD.
        While benchmarking, it was observed that the tape operations of the current implementation
        were significantly slowing down the program. This project aims to optimize and generalize
        the Clad tape to improve its efficiency, introduce multilayer storage, enhance thread safety,
        and enable CPU-GPU transfer.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        This project aims to introduce automatic differentiation techniques into
        the CMS Combine tool.  Combine is the primary statistical analysis tool
        used in CMS and is based on the RooFit software.  Recently RooFit has
        started using automatic differentiation (AD) technology to aid
        minimization algorithms.  Computationally cheap gradients produced by AD
        can improve performance of the larger workflows in Combine by more than
        5x as demonstrated at ICHEP.  The way how RooFit implements AD also
        benefits the shareability of likelihoods.  To get the likelihood
        gradient, RooFit transforms the likelihood from its internal
        representation to simple standalone C++ code, which is then used to
        generate the gradient code.  This can help collaborators without RooFit
        and Combine expertise to work with likelihoods from Combine at a lower
        level.  Adopting AD in Combine requires further collaboration between
        the parties.  This project aims to bring this AD support into Combine.
        Aspects include reducing some of the code in Combine in favor of more
        standard RooFit primitives; Implementing AD support for Combine-specific
        RooFit primitives; and writing benchmarks to showcase the benefits of
        RooFit AD in Combine.  The student selected for this project will work
        with several high-energy physics codes as well as the LLVM compiler
        ecosystem.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        Nowadays, the rise of AI has shed light into the power of GPUs. The
        notion of General Purpose GPU Programming is becoming more and more
        popular and it seems that the scientific community is increasingly
        favoring it over CPU Programming.  Consequently, implementation of
        mathematics and operations needed for such projects are getting adjusted
        to GPU's architecture.  Automatic differentiation is a notable concept
        in this context, finding applications across diverse domains from ML to
        Finance to Physics.  Clad is a clang plugin for automatic
        differentiation that performs source-to-source transformation and
        produces a function capable of computing the derivatives of a given
        function at compile time. This project aims to widen Clad’s use range
        and audience by enabling the reverse-mode automatic differentiation of
        CUDA kernels. The total goal of the project is to support the
        differentiation of CUDA kernels that may also include typical CUDA
        built-in objects (e.g. threadIdx, blockDim etc.), which are employed to
        prevent race conditions, using Clad. These produced kernels will compute
        the derivative of an argument specified by the user as the output based
        on an input parameter of their choosing. In addition, the user must be
        able to call these kernels with a custom grid configuration.

      status: Failed
      description: |
        Clad recursively iterates over the syntax tree to check whether a given
        statement should be differentiated. Each function that is called from
        inside of a differentiated function should be differentiated as well,
        and so should any object method. The main issue for clad is that std::thread is an object,
        and thus as a type that should be differentiated However, std::thread shouldn’t
        be differentiated, the function inside of it should.
        Some of STL’s concurrency primitives face the same problem -
        the methods in them should not be differentiated,
        and only the location of where they were called should be preserved.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is
        a set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function
        specified by a computer program. Automatic differentiation is an
        alternative technique to Symbolic differentiation and Numerical
        differentiation (the method of finite differences). Clad is based on
        Clang which provides the necessary facilities for code transformation.
        The AD library can differentiate non-trivial functions, to find a
        partial derivative for trivial cases and has good unit test coverage.

        C++ provides the specifiers consteval and constexpr to allow compile
        time evaluation of functions. constexpr declares a possibility, i.e the
        function will be evaluated at compile time if possible, else at runtime;
        whereas consteval makes it mandatory, i.e every call to the function
        must produce a compile-time constant.

        The aim of this project is to ensure that same semantics are followed by
        the generated derivative function, i.e if the primal function is
        evaluated at compile time (because of constexpr or consteval specifier),
        then the generated derivative code should also have the same specifier
        to be evaluatable at compile time.

        This will enable clad to demonstrate the benefits of doing automatic
        differentiation directly on C++ frontend to utilize the benefits of
        clang’s infrastructure.

            Cppyy is an automatic, run-time, Python-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from Python and Python from C++.
            Cppyy uses pythonized wrappers of useful classes from libraries like STL and Eigen that allow the user to utilize them on the Python side.
            Current support follows container types in STL like std::vector, std::map, and std::tuple and the Matrix-based classes in Eigen/Dense.
            These cppyy objects can be plugged into idiomatic expressions that expect Python builtin-types.
            This behaviour is achieved by growing pythonic methods like __len__ while also retaining its C++ methods like size.
            Efficient and automatic conversion between C++ and Python is essential towards high-performance cross-language support.
            This approach eliminates overheads arising from iterative initialization such as comma insertion in Eigen.
            This opens up new avenues for the utilization of Cppyy’s bindings in tools that perform numerical operations for transformations, or optimization.
            The on-demand C++ infrastructure wrapped by idiomatic Python enables new techniques in ML tools like JAX/CUTLASS.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        Xeus-cpp, a Jupyter kernel for C++, is built upon the native implementation of the Jupyter protocol, xeus. This setup empowers users to interactively write and execute C++ code, providing immediate visibility into the results.With its REPL (read-eval-print-loop) functionality, users can rapidly prototype and iterate without the need to compile and run separate C++ programs. Additionally, this integration facilitates seamless interaction between C++ and Python within the same Jupyter environment. With the ever growing popularity of large language models, this project aims to integrate a large language model with the xeus-cpp Jupyter kernel. This integration will enable users to interactively generate and execute code in C++ leveraging the assistance of the language model.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        This project aims to enhance the reliability and robustness of
        CppInterOp, a library facilitating language interoperability by
        exposing APIs from Clang and LLVM. Focusing on backward
        compatibility and minimalistic design, CppInterOp is instrumental
        in enabling downstream tools to embed Clang and LLVM in their
        codebases for dynamic interaction with C++. The project's primary
        objective is to improve the test coverage of CppInterOp by
        identifying and addressing potential edge cases, especially
        scenarios involving language interoperability and
        compiler-as-a-service functionalities. The outcome is expected to
        increase the overall reliability of the library, providing
        developers with a more stable foundation for utilizing CppInterOp
        in diverse scenarios. Previously I worked on improving the lookup
        of template specialization decls in clang modules.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        In terms of minimization time, RooFit offers faster results even with numerical
        differentiation techniques as compared to minimizing a likelihood function that
        is written by hand in C++, due its complex caching logic. Automatic differentiation
        gives an additional speedup and more accuracy and scalability for problems with large
        number of parameters. The purpose of this project will be to firstly use Minuit as
        an optimization algorithm with externally provided gradients, extend support to cover
        HistFactory and other parts of RooFit, and finally to optimize Clad generated derivatives a
        nd further explore how they can be parallelized (OpenMP or CUDA).

      status: Completed
      description: |
         xeus-clang-REPL is a C++ kernel for Jupyter notebooks using clang-REPL as its C++ Interpreter. Cppyy is an automatic, run-time, Python-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from Python and Python from C++. Allowing C++ and Python to talk between themselves in a Jupyter notebook will allow users to switch between Python and C++ at will. This means that data analysts can set up their analysis in Python while running the actual analysis in C++. Thus reducing the time to write and debug their analysis pipeline. Initial support of cross talk between the two kernels has been implemented but this only supports passing primitive data types. This project aims to use Cppyy to extend this to support classes and functions.

      description: |
        When a separate executor process is used with LLVM JIT, the generated
        code needs to be transferred to the executor process which is done by
        the JITLinkMemoryManager. The current implementation uses
        ExecutorProcessControl API (an RPC scheme) to send the generated code
        which goes through pipes or network sockets. The goal of the project is
        to transfer it through an operating system provided shared memory
        regions for better performance, when both the JIT process and the
        executor process are sharing the same underlying physical memory. It
        should be done by allocating large chunks of memory and distributing it
        to reduce memory allocation and inter process communication overheads.

    - title: "Re-optimization using JITLink"
      status: Completed
      description: |
        In Just-In-Time compilers we often choose a low optimization level to
        minimize compile time and improve launch times and latencies, however
        some functions (which we call hot functions) are used very frequently
        and for these functions it is worth optimizing more heavily. In general
        hot functions can only be identified at runtime (different inputs will
        cause different functions to become hot), so the aim of the
        reoptimization project is to build infrastructure to (1) detect hot
        functions at runtime and (2) compile them a second time at a higher
        optimization level, hence the name "re-optimization". There are many
        possible approaches to both parts of this problem. E.g. hot functions
        could be identified by sampling, or using existing profiling
        infrastructure, or by implementing custom
        instrumentation. Reoptimization could be applied to whole functions, or
        outlining could be used to enable optimization of portions of
        functions. Re-entry into the JIT infrastructure from JIT'd code might be
        implemented on top of existing lazy compilation, or via a custom path.

        JITLink is LLVM’s new JIT linker API -- the low-level API that
        transforms compiler output (relocatable object files) into
        ready-to-execute bytes in memory. With its new architecture, it is able
        to support a variety of new features, which includes static initializer,
        thread local storage, and small code model, that were not possible in
        RuntimeDyld, the old JIT API.  JITLink’s generic linker algorithm needs
        to be specialized to support the target object format (COFF, ELF,
        MachO), and architecture (arm, arm64, i386, x86-64). This project aims
        to implement the JITLink specialization for ELF/aarch64 which is
        required to use JITLink in arm64 linux.

      status: Complete
      description: |
        RooFit is a toolkit for statistical modeling and fitting used by most
        experiments in particle physics. Just as data sets from next-generation
        experiments grow, processing requirements for physics analysis become
        more computationally demanding, necessitating performance optimizations
        for RooFit. One possibility to speed-up minimization and add stability
        is the use of automatic differentiation (AD). Unlike for numerical
        differentiation, the computation cost scales linearly with the number of
        parameters, making AD particularly appealing for statistical models with
        many parameters. The goal of this project is to add preliminary support
        for AD in RooFit and develop benchmarks to demonstrate the advantages of
        AD for large statistical fits using RooFit.

    - title: "Add Numerical Differentiation Support in Clad"
      status: Completed
      description: |
        In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is a
        set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function
        specified by a computer program. Automatic differentiation is an
        alternative technique to Symbolic differentiation and Numerical
        differentiation (the method of finite differences). Clad is based on
        Clang which provides the necessary facilities for code
        transformation. The AD library can differentiate non-trivial functions,
        find a partial derivative for trivial cases, and has good unit test
        coverage.  In several cases, due to different limitations, it is either
        inefficient or impossible to differentiate a function. For example, clad
        cannot differentiate declared-but-not-defined functions. In that case,
        it issues an error. Instead, clad should fall back to its future
        numerical differentiation facilities.

    - title: "Floating point error evaluation with Clad"
      status: Completed
      description: |
        Floating-point estimation errors have been a testament to the finite
        nature of computing. Moreover, the predominance of Floating-point
        numbers in real-valued computation does not help that fact. Float
        computations are highly dependent on precision, and in most cases, very
        high precision calculation is not only not possible but very
        inefficient. Here, one has no choice but to resort to lower precision
        computing, which in turn is quite prone to errors. These errors result
        in inaccurate and sometimes catastrophic results; hence, it is
        imperative to estimate these errors accurately. This project aims to use
        Clad, a source transformation AD tool for C++ implemented as a plugin
        for the C++ compiler Clang, to develop a generic error estimation
        framework that is not bound to a particular error approximation
        model. It will allow users to select their preferable estimation logic
        and automatically generate functions augmented with code for the
        specified error estimator.

    - title: "Improving Cling Reflection for Scripting Languages"
      status: Completed
      description: |
        Cling has basic facilities to make queries about the C++ code that it
        has seen/collected so far.  These lookups assume, however, that the
        caller knows what it is looking for and the information returned,
        although exact, usually only makes sense within C++ and is thus often
        too specific to be used as-is. A scripting language, such as Python,
        that wants to make use of such lookups by name, is forced to loop over
        all possible entities (classes, functions, templates, enums, …)  to find
        a match. This is inefficient. Furthermore, many lookups will be
        multi-stage: a function, but which overload? A template, but which
        instantiation? A typedef, of what? The current mechanism forces the
        scripting language to provide a type-based match, even where C++ makes
        distinctions (e.g. pointer v.s. reference) that do not exist in the
        scripting language. This, too, makes lookups very inefficient. The
        returned information, once a match is found, is exact, but because of
        its specificity, requires the caller to figure out C++ concepts that
        have no meaning in the scripting language. E.g., there is no reason for
        Python to consider an implicitly instantiated function template
        different from an explicitly instantiated one.

          that laborious typing, and it is also type-directed in that completion
          candidates are well-typed with respect to cursor positions. The
          project incorporates the completion infrastructure of Cling into
          Clang-REPL. Next, we build components that handle type contexts and
          subtypes. Lastly, we combine the completion and type-related
          components to deliver the type-directed auto-completion in Clang-REPL.

        Clang-REPL is the evolution of Cling, an interactive c++ interpreter

        Clang-REPL project is to move most parts of Cling into LLVM. By doing
        so, the benefits of using the LLVM community standards for code reviews,
        release cycles and integration will ensure the software's
        sustainability, and will enable it to reach a wider audience. My goal is

        continue to evolve.

        clang-repl is the upstream version of Cling Interpreter, which only
        implements a subset of features in Cling. In this proposal, we try to
        bring value printing, a very useful feature that enables users to know
        the detailed information of the expressions that users have inputted

    - title: "Improving Interactive Tool Analysis Documentation for the HSF"
      status: Failed
      description: |
        HEP researchers have developed several unique software technologies in
        the area of data analysis. Over the last decade we developed an
        interactive, interpretative C++ interpreter (aka REPL) as part of the
        ROOT data analysis project. We invested a significant effort to replace
        CINT, the C++ interpreter used until ROOT5, with a newly implemented
        REPL based on LLVM Cling. Cling is a core component of ROOT and has been
        in production since 2014. Cling is also a standalone tool, which has a
        growing community outside of our field. It is recognized for enabling
        interactivity, dynamic interoperability and rapid prototyping
        capabilities for C++ developers. For example, if you are typing C++ in a
        Jupyter notebook you are using the xeus-cling Jupyter kernel. So we are
        in the midst of an important project to address one of the major
        challenges to ensure Clings sustainability and to foster that growing
        community: moving most parts of Cling into LLVM. Since LLVM version 13
        we have a version of Cling called Clang-Repl. As we advance the
        implementation and generalize its usage here we aim for improving the
        overall documentation experience in the area of interactive C++.

    - title: "Add Initial Integration of Clad with Enzyme"
      status: Completed
      description: |
        Clad is an open source plugin to the Clang compiler that detects from
        the parsed Abstract syntax tree, calls to differentiate a defined
        function, generates code that differentiates the function using the
        concept of Automatic Differentiation(AD) and modifies the Abstract
        Syntax Tree(AST) to insert the generated code. While clad works in the
        frontend of the compilation process, Enzyme, another LLVM based AD
        plugin works in the backend, where it takes in code in LLVM IR form and
        then differentiates the code. This proposal aims to integrate Clad with
        Enzyme, and give the user the option of selecting Enzyme for Automatic
        Differentiation, based on his/her needs. This will give the user the
        same User Interface as clad for writing his/her code, but the option of
        using Enzyme as the backend with all its optimizations to calculate the
        Derivative/Gradient of the requested function.  My proposal also briefly
        gives insights into how this can be achieved by tapping into the
        existing code base of Clad.

    - title: "Improving performance of C++ modules in Clang"
      status: Incomplete
      description: |
        The C++ modules technology aims to provide a scalable compilation model
        for the C++ language. The C++ Modules technology in Clang provides an
        io-efficient, on-disk representation capable to reduce build times and
        peak memory usage. The internal compiler state such as the abstract
        syntax tree (AST) is stored on disk and lazily loaded on demand. C++
        Modules improve the memory footprint for interpreted C++ through the
        Cling C++ interpreter developed by CERN and the compiler research group
        at Princeton. The current implementation is pretty good at making most
        operations on demand. However in a few cases, we eagerly load pieces of
        the AST, for example at module import time and upon selecting a suitable
        template specialization. When selecting the template specialization we
        load all template specializations from the module files just to find out
        they are not suitable. There is a patch that partially solves this issue
        by introducing a template argument hash and use it to look up the
        candidates without deserializing them. However, the data structure it
        uses to store the hashes leads to quadratic search which is inefficient
        when the number of modules becomes sufficiently large.

    - title: Preserve type sugar for member access on template specializations
      status: Complete
      description: |
        In C++, it's often useful to write wrappers that abstract or extend some
        underlying type passed as a template argument. But templates are only
        instantiated taking into account the 'fundamental' types of the
        arguments, discarding 'type sugar', such as any aliases, attributes or
        other cosmetic metadata such as how the name of the type was qualified
        and such. While this ends up in practice being brittle to rely on,
        attributes on the type itself or a typedef thereof can have many
        interesting non-cosmetic effects, like changing data alignment, calling
        conventions, and other custom / domain specific functionality.  We refer
        to such 'fundamental' types as 'canonical' types here.  Without any
        further engineering to work around this limitation, member accesses on
        template specializations will only reflect these canonical types, with
        the simplest example being the loss of any sugar on the argument when
        accessing a member alias to the argument itself.  For this project, we
        will improve Clang's type system so that any type sugar on the arguments
        of a template specialization are pushed into those member accesses.

    - title: "Add support for custom types in Clad with a focus on the Softsusy library"
      status: Complete
      description: |
        User-defined types in C++ helps to make code more readable and
        maintainable.  Many user-defined programs and almost every major library
        uses user-defined types. Thus it is very crucial for clad to support
        differentiating user-defined types. The first goal of the project is to
        add support for differentiating user-defined types in clad. Clad
        currently also does not support many C++ syntaxes. Many of these are
        essential and are very well used in day-to-day programming such as break
        and continue statements. The second goal of the project is to battle
        test clad on Eigen and softsusy library codebases to find and add
        support for most of the missing syntax as well as to improve support for
        differentiating function calls.

      description: |
        Differentiation support for functions is available in clad. But support

        lambda expressions are becoming more and more relevant in modern

    - title: "Enhance the incremental compilation error recovery in clang and clang-repl"
      status: Completed
      description: |
        The Clang compiler is part of the LLVM compiler infrastructure and
        supports various languages such as C, C++, ObjC and ObjC++. Advancements
        in JIT infrastructure and usability of Clang libraries in LLVM has enabled
        research into processing C++. It has been challenging to include
        incremental compilation and fitting compile time optimizations into a
        more dynamic environment. Incremental compilation pipelines process code
        chunk-by-chunk by building an ever-growing translation unit. Code is
        then lowered into the LLVM IR and subsequently run by the LLVM JIT. The
        incremental compilation mode is used by the interactive C++ interpreter,
        Cling, initially developed to enable interactive high-energy physics
        analysis in a C++ environment. Clang-repl is a new-tool incorporated in
        LLVM ecosystem by redesigning parts of Cling in Clang mainline. The
        project aims at enhancing the error recovery when users type C++ at the
        prompt of clang-repl.

        standard C++. Reducing boost dependencies helps us create more
        lightweight boost clang modules for upcoming c++20. This also reduces
        the amount of headers that we need to work on to be able to use c++20
        clang modules.

      status: Completed
      description: |
        ROOT has several features that interact with libraries and require
        implicit header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing
        data on disk, or user actions at the prompt. Exposing the full shared
        library descriptors to the interpreter at runtime translates into an
        increased memory footprint.  ROOT’s exploratory programming concepts
        allow implicit and explicit runtime shared library loading. It requires
        the interpreter to load the library descriptor. Re-parsing of
        descriptors’ content has a noticeable effect on runtime performance. C++
        Modules are designed to minimize the re-parsing of the same header
        content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of the C++
        Code. C++ Modules have been implemented for Unix and OS X systems
        already and it is expected that with next release of ROOT, C++ modules
        will be default on OS X. This project aims to extend the C++ Modules
        support for Windows, by implementing compatible solutions to the UNIX
        baseline and also display corresponding performance results.

        This project has the goal to find and decrease boost dependencies in

      description: |
        In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is a
        set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function
        specified by a computer program. Automatic differentiation is an
        alternative technique to Symbolic differentiation and Numerical
        differentiation (the method of finite differences). CLAD is based on
        Clang which will provide the necessary facilities for code
        transformation. The AD library is able to differentiate non-trivial
        functions, to find a partial derivative for trivial cases and has good
        unit test coverage.  Currently, clad does not provide an easy way to
        compute Jacobians.
