  version: "v2.1"
  description: |
    Clad 2.1 introduces major advancements in reverse mode differentiation,
    bringing smarter handling of loops, assignments, and method calls, alongside
    the new clad::restore_tracker for functions that modify their
    inputs. Forward mode gains static scheduling for Hessians and higher-order
    derivatives, while CUDA support expands with custom derivatives for key
    Thrust algorithms such as reduce, transform, and transform_reduce, plus
    optimizations that reduce unnecessary GPU atomics. The release also
    strengthens error estimation, simplifies adjoint initialization, improves
    tape efficiency, and enhances diagnostics. With a migration to C++17,
    support extended up to clang-21, and numerous bug fixes, Clad 2.1 delivers
    faster, safer, and more reliable automatic differentiation across CPU and
    GPU workflows.

  version: "v2.0"
  description: |
    Clad 2.0 introduces improvements across both forward and reverse automatic
    differentiation modes, including the adoption of static scheduling by
    default and expanded support for custom derivatives, such as those involving
    STL containers and iterators. The release enhances compatibility with Clang
    versions 10 through 20 and extends support for CUDA through updated tape
    handling. Additional updates include improved error diagnostics, support for
    more complex object types, and infrastructure for benchmarking.

  description: |
    This release introduces significant updates, including support for clang
    versions 10 through 20 and improved diagnostics for unsupported features.
    Forward mode now handles variadic functions, while reverse mode sees major
    enhancements like marking const methods as non-differentiable, enabling
    differentiation of global variables and static member functions, generating
    constructor pullbacks automatically, and reducing tape usage through
    optimizations. CUDA support has been expanded with better handling of
    device pullbacks and kernel variables.
