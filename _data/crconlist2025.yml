      time_cest: "15:00 - 15:20"
      description: |
        This proposal outlines integrating debugging into the xeus-cpp kernel 
        for Jupyter using LLDB and its Debug Adapter Protocol (lldb-dap). 
        Modeled after xeus-python, it leverages LLDB’s Clang and JIT debugging 
        support to enable breakpoints, variable inspection, and step-through 
        execution. The modular design ensures compatibility with Jupyter’s 
        frontend, enhancing interactive C++ development in notebooks.

        This project achieved DAP protocol integration with xeus-cpp. User can 
        use the JupyterLab’s debugger panel to debug C++ JIT code. Applying and 
        hitting breakpoints, stepping in and out of functions are supported in 
        xeus-cpp. Additionally, during this project I had refactored 
        the Out-of-Process JIT execution which was the major part in implementing 
        the debugger.

        Clad is a Clang plugin designed to provide automatic differentiation (AD) for C++ 
        mathematical functions. It generates code for computing derivatives modifying 
        Abstract-Syntax-Tree(AST) using LLVM compiler features. It performs advanced program 
        optimization by implementing more sophisticated analyses because it has access to a 
        rich program representation – the Clang AST. 

        The project achieved to optimize code  that contains potential data-race conditions, 
        significantly speeding up the execution. Thread Safety Analysis is a static analysis 
        that detects possible data-race conditions that would enable reducing atomic 
        operations in the Clad-produced code.

        This project extends Clad, a Clang-based automatic differentiation tool for C++, to 
        support OpenMP programs. This project enables Clad to parse and differentiate 
        functions with OpenMP directives, thereby enabling gradient computation in 
        multi-threaded environments.

        This project achieved Clad support for both forward and reverse mode differentiation 
        of common OpenMP directives (parallel, parallel for) and clauses (private, 
        firstprivate, lastprivate, shared, atomic, reduction) by implementing OpenMP-related 
        AST parsing and designing corresponding differentiation strategies. Additional 
        contributions include example applications and comprehensive tests.

    - title: "Using ROOT in the field of Genome Sequencing"
      speaker:
        name: "Aditya Pandey"
      time_cest: "16:00 - 16:20"
      description: |
        The project extends ROOT, CERN's petabyte-scale data processing framework, to address 
        the critical challenge of managing genomic data that generates upto 200GB per human 
        genome. By leveraging ROOT's big data expertise and introducing the next-generation 
        RNTuple columnar storage format specifically optimized for genomic sequences, the 
        project eliminates the traditional trade-off between compression efficiency and 
        access speed in bioinformatics.

        The project achieved comprehensive genomic data support through validating GeneROOT 
        baseline performance benchmarks against BAM/SAM formats, implementing RNTuple-based 
        RAM (ROOT Alignment Maps) format with full SAM/BAM field support and smart reference 
        management, demonstrating 23.5% smaller file sizes compared to CRAM while delivering 
        1.9x faster large region queries and 3.2x faster full chromosome scans, optimizing 
        FASTQ compression from 14.2GB to 6.8GB. We also developed chromosome based 
        file-splitting for larger genome file so that chromosome based data can be extracted.

    - title: "CARTopiaX an Agent-Based Simulation of CAR T-Cell Therapy built on BioDynaMo"
      speaker:
        name: "Salvador de la Torre Gonzalez"
      time_cest: "15:00 - 15:20"
      description: |
        CAR- T-cell therapy is a form of cancer immunotherapy that engineers a 
        patient’s T cells to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. Although 
        highly effective in leukemias and other hematological cancers, this therapy 
        faces significant challenges in solid tumors due to the complex and 
        heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. CARTopiaX is an advanced agent-based 
        model developed to address this challenge, using the mathematical framework 
        proposed in the Nature paper “In silico study of heterogeneous tumour-derived 
        organoid response to CAR T-cell therapy,” successfully replicating its core 
        results. Built on BioDynaMo, a high-performance, open-source platform for 
        large-scale and modular biological modeling, CARTopiaX enables detailed 
        exploration of complex biological interactions, hypothesis testing, and 
        data-driven discovery within solid tumor microenvironments. 

        The project achieved major milestones, including simulations that run more than 
        twice as fast as previous model, allowing rapid scenario exploration and robust 
        hypothesis validation; high-quality, well-structured, and maintainable C++ code 
        developed following modern software engineering principles; and a scalable, 
        modular, and extensible architecture that fosters collaboration, customization, 
        and the continuous evolution of an open-source ecosystem. Altogether, this work 
        represents a meaningful advancement in computational biology, providing 
        researchers with a powerful tool to investigate CAR- T- cell dynamics in solid 
        tumors and accelerating scientific discovery while reducing the time and cost 
        associated with experimental wet-lab research.

    - title: "Efficient LLM Training in C++ via Compiler-Level Autodiff with Clad"
      speaker:
        name: "Rohan Timmaraju"
      time_cest: "15:20 - 15:40"
      description: |
        The computational demands of Large Language Model (LLM) training are 
        often constrained by the performance of Python frameworks. This project 
        tackles these bottlenecks by developing a high-performance LLM training 
        pipeline in C++ using Clad, a Clang plugin for compiler-level automatic 
        differentiation. The core of this work involved creating cladtorch, a new 
        C++ tensor library with a PyTorch-style API designed for compatibility 
        with Clad's differentiation capabilities. This library provides a more 
        user-friendly interface for building and training neural networks while 
        enabling Clad to automatically generate gradient computations for 
        backpropagation.

        Throughout the project, I successfully developed two distinct LLM training 
        implementations. The first, using the cladtorch library, established a 
        functional and flexible framework for Clad-driven AD. To further push 
        performance boundaries, I then developed a second, highly-optimized 
        implementation inspired by llm.c, which utilizes pre-allocated memory buffers 
        and custom kernels. This optimized C-style approach, when benchmarked for 
        GPT-2 training on a multithreaded CPU, outperformed the equivalent PyTorch 
        implementation. This work successfully demonstrates the viability and 
        performance benefits of compiler-based AD for deep learning in C++ and 
        provides a strong foundation for future hardware acceleration, such as porting 
        the implementation to CUDA.

    - title: "Implement and improve an efficient, layered tape with prefetching capabilities"
      speaker:
        name: "Aditi Milind Joshi"
      time_cest: "15:40 - 16:00"
      description: |
        Clad relies on a tape data structure to store intermediate values during reverse 
        mode differentiation. This project focuses on enhancing the core tape implementation 
        in Clad to make it more efficient and scalable. Key deliverables include replacing 
        the existing dynamic array-based tape with a slab allocation approach and small 
        buffer optimization, enabling multilayer storage, and introducing thread safety to 
        support concurrent access.

        The current implementation replaces the dynamic array with a slab-based structure 
        and a small static buffer, eliminating costly reallocations. Thread-safe access 
        functions have been added through a mutex locking mechanism, ensuring safe parallel 
        tape operations. Ongoing work includes developing a multilayer tape system with 
        offloading capabilities, which will allow only the most recent slabs to remain in 
        memory.

      description: |
        This project integrates NVIDIA's Thrust library into Clad, a Clang-based automatic 
        differentiation tool for C++. By extending Clad's source-to-source transformation 
        engine to recognize and differentiate Thrust parallel algorithms, the project 
        enables automatic gradient generation for GPU-accelerated scientific computing 
        and machine learning applications.

        The project achieved Thrust support in Clad through implementing custom derivatives 
        for core algorithms including thrust::reduce, thrust::transform, 
        thrust::transform_reduce, thrust::inner_product, thrust::copy, scan operations 
        (inclusive/exclusive), thrust::adjacent_difference, and sorting primitives. 
        Additional contributions include Thrust data containers like thrust::device_vector, 
        generic functor handling for transformations, demonstration applications, and 
        comprehensive unit tests.
