- title: "Using C++ From Numba, Fast and Automatic"
  description: |
    The scientific community using Python has developed several ways to
    accelerate Python codes. One popular technology is Numba, a Just-in-time
    (JIT) compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast
    machine code using LLVM. We have extended Numba's integration with LLVM's
    intermediate representation (IR) to enable the use of C++ kernels and
    connect them to Numba accelerated codes. Such a multilanguage setup is also
    commonly used to achieve performance or to interface with external
    bare-metal libraries. In addition, Numba users will be able to write the
    performance-critical codes in C++ and use them easily at native speed.

    This work relies on high-performance, dynamic, bindings between Python and
    C++. Cppyy, which is the basis of PyROOT's interfaces to C++ libraries.
    Cppyy uses Cling, an incremental C++ interpreter, to generate on-demand
    bindings of required entities and connect them with the Python interpreter.
    This environment is uniquely positioned to enable the use of C++ from Numba
    in a fast and automatic way.

    In this talk, we demonstrate using C++ from Numba through Cppyy. We show
    our approach which extends Cppyy to match the object typing and lowering
    models of Numba and the necessary additions to the reflection layers to
    generate IR from Python objects. The uniform LLVM runtime allows
    optimizations such as inlining which can in the future remove the C++
    function call overhead. We discuss other optimizations such as lazily
    instantiated C++ templates based on input data. The talk also briefly
    outlines the non-negligible, Numba-introduced JIT overhead and possible
    ways to optimize it. Since this is built as a Cppyy extension Numba
    supports all bindings automatically without any user intervention.

- title: "Automatic Differentiation of Binned Likelihoods With RooFit and Clad"
  description: |
    RooFit is a toolkit for statistical modeling and fitting used by most
    experiments in particle physics. Just as data sets from next-generation
    experiments grow, processing requirements for physics analysis become more
    computationally demanding, necessitating performance optimizations for
    RooFit. One possibility to speed-up minimization and add stability is the
    use of automatic differentiation (AD). Unlike for numerical differentiation,
    the computation cost scales linearly with the number of parameters, making AD
    particularly appealing for statistical models with many parameters. In this
    talk, we report on one possible way to implement AD in RooFit. Our approach
    is to add a facility to generate C++ code for a full RooFit model automatically.
    Unlike the original RooFit model, this generated code is free of virtual
    function calls and other RooFit-specific overhead. In particular, this code
    is then used to produce the gradient automatically with Clad. Clad is a source
    transformation AD tool implemented as a plugin to the clang compiler, which
    automatically generates the derivative code for input C++ functions. We show
    results demonstrating the improvements observed when applying this code
    generation strategy to HistFactory and other commonly used RooFit models.

    HistFactory is the subcomponent of RooFit that implements binned likelihood
    models with probability densities based on histogram templates. These models
    frequently have a very large number of free parameters, and are thus an
    interesting first target for AD support in RooFit.

- title: "Adapting C++ for Data Science"
  description: |
    Over the last decade the C++ programming language has evolved significantly
    into safer, easier to learn and better supported by tools general purpose
    programming language capable of extracting the last bit of performance from
    bare metal. The emergence of technologies such as LLVM and Clang have
    advanced tooling support for C++ and its ecosystem grew qualitatively.
    C++ has an important role in the field of scientific computing as the
    language design principles promote efficiency, reliability and backward
    compatibility - a vital tripod for any long-lived codebase. Other
    ecosystems such as Python have prioritized better usability and safety
    while making some tradeoffs on efficiency and backward compatibility. That
    has led developers to believe that there is a binary choice between
    performance and usability.

    In this talk we would like to present the advancements in the C++ ecosystem;
    its relevance for scientific computing and beyond; and foreseen challenges.
    The talk introduces three major components for data science - interpreted
    C++; automatic language bindings; and differentiable programming. We outline
    how these components help Python and C++ ecosystems interoperate making a
    little compromise on either performance or usability. We elaborate on a
    future hybrid Python/C++ differentiable programming analysis framework which
    might accelerate science discovery in HEP by amplifying the power and
    physics sensitivity of data analyses into end-to-end differentiable
    pipelines.

- title: "Automatic Differentiation in ROOT"
  description: |
    Automatic Differentiation is a powerful technique to evaluate the derivative of
    a function specified by a computer program. Thanks to the ROOT interpreter, Cling,
    this technique is available in ROOT for computing gradients and Hessian matrices of
    multi-dimensional functions. We will present the current integration of this tool
    in the ROOT Mathematical libraries for computing gradients of functions that can
    then be used in numerical algorithms. For example, we demonstrate the correctness
    and performance improvements in ROOTâ€™s fitting algorithms. We will show also how
    gradient and Hessian computation via AD is integrated in the main ROOT minimization
    algorithm Minuit. We will show also the present plans to integrate the Automatic
    Differentiation in the RooFit modelling package for obtaining gradients of the full
    model that can be used for fitting and other statistical studies.

- title: "Estimating Floating-Point Errors Using Automatic Differentiation"
  description: |
    Floating-point errors are a testament to the finite nature of computing
    and if left uncontrolled they can have catastrophic results. As such, for
    high-precision computing applications, quantifying these uncertainties
    becomes imperative. There have been significant efforts to mitigate such
    errors by either extending the underlying floating-point precision, using
    alternate compensation algorithms or estimating them using a variety of
    statistical and non-statistical methods. A prominent method of dynamic
    floating-point error estimation is using Automatic Differentiation (AD).
    However, most state-of-the-art AD-based estimation software requires
    manually adapting or annotating the source code by some amount. Moreover,
    operator overloading AD based error estimation tools call for multiple
    gradient recomputations to report errors over a large variety of inputs
    and suffer from all the shortcomings of the underlying operator
    overloading strategy such as reduced efficiency. In this work, we propose
    a customizable way to use AD to synthesize source code for estimating
    uncertainties arising from floating-point arithmetic in C/C++ applications.

    Our work presents an automatic error annotation framework that can be used
    in conjunction with custom user defined error models. We also present our
    progress with error estimation on GPU applications.

- title: "GPU Acceleration of Automatic Differentiation in C++ with Clad"
  description: |
    Automatic Differentiation (AD) is instrumental for science and industry. It
    is a tool to evaluate the derivative of a function specified through a
    computer program. The range of AD application domain spans from Machine
    Learning to Robotics to High Energy Physics. Computing gradients with the
    help of AD is guaranteed to be more precise than the numerical alternative
    and have at most a constant factor (4) more arithmetical operations compared
    to the original function. Moreover, AD applications to domain problems
    typically are computationally bound. They are often limited by the
    computational requirements of high-dimensional transformation parameters and
    thus can greatly benefit from parallel implementations on graphics
    processing units (GPUs).

    Clad aims to enable differentiable analysis for C/C++ and CUDA and is a
    compiler-assisted AD tool available both as a compiler extension and in
    ROOT. Moreover, Clad works as a compiler plugin extending the Clang
    compiler; as a plugin extending the interactive interpreter Cling; and as
    a Jupyter kernel extension based on xeus-cling.

    In this talk, we demonstrate the advantages of parallel gradient
    computations on graphics processing units (GPUs) with Clad. We explain how
    to bring forth a new layer of optimisation and a proportional speed up by
    extending the usage of Clad for CUDA. The gradients of well-behaved C++
    functions can be automatically executed on a GPU. Thus, across the spectrum
    of fields, researchers can reuse their existing models and have workloads
    scheduled on parallel processors without the need to optimize their
    computational kernels. The library can be easily integrated into existing
    frameworks or used interactively, and provides optimal performance.
    Furthermore, we demonstrate the achieved application performance
    improvements, including (~10x) in ROOT histogram fitting and corresponding
    performance gains from offloading to GPUs.

- title: "Enabling Interactive C++ with Clang"
  description: |
    The design of LLVM and Clang enables them to be used as libraries, and has
    led to the creation of an entire compiler-assisted ecosystem of tools. The
    relatively friendly codebase of Clang and advancements in the JIT
    infrastructure in LLVM further enable research into different methods for
    processing C++ by blurring the boundary between compile time and runtime.
    Challenges include incremental compilation and fitting compile/link time
    optimizations into a more dynamic environment.

    Incremental compilation pipelines process code chunk-by-chunk by building an
    ever-growing translation unit. Code is then lowered into the LLVM IR and
    subsequently run by the LLVM JIT. Such a pipeline allows creation of
    efficient interpreters. The interpreter enables interactive exploration and
    makes the C++ language more user friendly. The incremental compilation mode
    is used by the interactive C++ interpreter, Cling, initially developed to
    enable interactive high-energy physics analysis in a C++ environment. Cling
    is now used for interactive development in Jupyter Notebooks
    (via xeus-cling), dynamic python bindings (via cppyy) and interactive CUDA
    development.

    In this talk we dive into the details of implementing incremental
    compilation with Clang. We outline a path forward for `Clang-Repl` which is
    built with the experience gained in Cling and is now available in mainstream
    llvm. We describe how the new Orc JIT infrastructure allows us to naturally
    perform static optimizations at runtime, and enables linker voodoo to make
    the compiler/interpreter boundaries disappear. We explain the potential of
    having a compiler-as-a-service architecture in the context of automatic
    language interoperability for Python and beyond.

- title: "Enabling Interactive C++ with Clang"
  description: |
    Clad enables automatic differentiation (AD) for C++ algorithms through
    source-to-source transformation. It is based on LLVM compiler infrastructure
    and as a Clang compiler plugin. Different from other tools, Clad manipulates
    the high-level code representation (the AST) rather than implementing its
    own C++ parser and does not require modifications to existing code bases.
    This methodology is both easier to adopt and potentially more performant
    than other approaches. Having full access to the Clang compiler's internals
    means that Clad is able to follow the high-level semantics of algorithms and
    can perform domain-specific optimisations; automatically generate code
    (re-targeting C++) on accelerator hardware with appropriate scheduling;
    and has a direct connection to compiler diagnostics engine and thus
    producing precise and expressive diagnostics positioned at desired source
    locations.

    In this talk, we showcase the above mentioned advantages through examples
    and outline Clad&#8217;s features, applications and support extensions. We
    describe the challenges coming from supporting automatic differentiation of
    broader C++ and present how Clad can compute derivatives of functions,
    member functions, functors and lambda expressions. We show the newly added
    support of array differentiation which provides the basis utility for CUDA
    support and parallelisation of gradient computation. Moreover, we will demo
    different interactive use-cases of Clad, either within a Jupyter environment
    as a kernel extension based on xeus-cling or within a gpu-cpu environment
    where the gradient computation can be accelerated through gpu-code produced
    by Clad and run with the help of the Cling interpreter.

- title: "Interactive C++ for Data Science"
  description: |
    C++ is used for many numerically intensive applications. A combination of
    performance and solid backward compatibility has led to its use for many
    research software codes over the past 20 years. Despite its power, C++ is
    often seen as difficult to learn and not well suited with rapid application
    development. The long edit-compile-run cycle is a large impediment to
    exploration and prototyping during development.

    Cling has emerged as a recognized capability that enables interactivity,
    dynamic interoperability and rapid prototyping capabilities for C++
    developers. Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of the
    Clang and LLVM compiler infrastructure. The interpreter enables interactive
    exploration and makes the C++ language more welcoming for research. Cling
    supports the full C++ feature set including the use of templates, lambdas,
    and virtual inheritance.Clingâ€™s field of origin is the field of high energy
    physics where it facilitates the processing of scientific data. The
    interpreter was an essential part of the software tools of the LHC
    experimental program and was part of the software used to detect the
    gravitational waves of the LIGO experiment. Interactive C++ has proven to be
    useful for other communities. The Cling ecosystem includes dynamic bindings
    tools to languages including python, D and Julia (cppyy); C++ in Jupyter
    Notebooks (xeus-cling); interactive CUDA; and automatic differentiation on
    the fly (clad).

    This talk outlines key properties of interactive C++ such as execution
    results, entity redefinition, error recovery and code undo. It demonstrates
    the capability enabled by an interactive C++ platform in the context of data
    science. For example, the use of eval-style programming, C++ in Jupyter
    notebooks and CUDA C++. We talk about design and implementation challenges
    and go beyond just interpreting C++. We showcase template instantiation on
    demand, language interoperability on demand and bridging compiled and
    interpreted code. We show how to easily build new capabilities using the
    Cling infrastructure through developing an automatic differentiation plugin
    for C++ and CUDA.

- title: "Differentiable Programming in C++"
  description: |
    Mathematical derivatives are vital components of many computing algorithms
    including: neural networks, numerical optimization, Bayesian inference,
    nonlinear equation solvers, physics simulations, sensitivity analysis, and
    nonlinear inverse problems. Derivatives track the rate of change of an
    output parameter with respect to an input parameter, such as how much
    reducing an individualsâ€™ carbon footprint will impact the Earthâ€™s
    temperature. Derivatives (and generalizations such as gradients, jacobians,
    hessians, etc) allow us to explore the properties of a function and better
    describe the underlying process as a whole. In recent years, the use of
    gradient-based optimizations such as training neural networks have become
    widespread, leading to many languages making differentiation a first-class
    citizen.

    Derivatives can be computed numerically, but unfortunately the accumulation
    of floating-point errors and high-computational complexity presents several
    challenges. These problems become worse with higher order derivatives and
    more parameters to differentiate.

    Many derivative-based algorithms require gradients, or the computation of
    the derivative of an output parameter with respect to many input parameters.
    As such, developing techniques for computing gradients that are scalable in
    the number of input parameters is crucial for the performance of such
    algorithms. This paper describes a broad set of domains where scalable
    derivative computations are essential. We make an overview of the major
    techniques in computing derivatives, and finally, we introduce the flagman
    of computational differential calculus -- algorithmic (also known as
    automatic) differentiation (AD). AD makes clever use of the â€˜niceâ€™
    mathematical properties of the chained rule and generative programming to
    solve the scalability issues by inverting the dependence on the number of
    input variables to the number of output variables. AD provides mechanisms to
    augment the regular function computation with instructions calculating its
    derivatives.

    Differentiable programming is a programming paradigm in which the programs
    can be differentiated throughout, usually via automatic differentiation.
    This talk introduces the differentiable programming paradigm in terms of
    C++. It shows its applications in science as applicable for data science
    and industry. The authors make an overview of the existing tools in the area
    and the two common implementation approaches -- template metaprogramming and
    custom parsers. We demonstrate implementation pros and cons and propose
    compiler toolchain-based implementation either in clang AST or LLVM IR. We
    would like to briefly outline our current efforts in standardization of that
    feature.
