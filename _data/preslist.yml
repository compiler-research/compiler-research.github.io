- title: "Accelerating Large Scientific Workflows Using Source Transformation Automatic Differentiation"
  description: |
    In this presentation, we will delve into the innovative world of Clad, an
    automatic differentiation (AD) tool designed for C++. We introduce the Clad
    programming model and highlight the advantages of employing
    transformation-based automatic differentiation within high-performance
    static languages like C++. Through practical examples, we demonstrate how
    Clad can be leveraged at scale.

    Our discussion will also focus on the integration of AD into RooFit, a
    toolkit extensively utilized in high-energy physics and nuclear physics
    experiments for statistical modeling. We showcase how the new AD backend
    effectively extracts differentiable properties from decades-old
    infrastructure, resulting in enhanced performance and numeric stability
    during likelihood minimizations.

    One of the key aspects of our approach is the development of a generic
    methodology to transform the object-oriented compute graph within RooFit
    into overhead-free C++ code, making it amenable to AD. This transformation
    enables us to apply AD to large production workflows consisting of hundreds
    of thousands of lines of scientific codes. Furthermore, we will illustrate
    that AD emerges as the preferred choice for workflows involving numerous
    parameters. It leads to reduced minimization times, faster overall fit
    convergence by minimizing fit iterations, and improved accuracy in gradient
    calculations.

- title: "Unlocking the Power of C++ as a Service: Uniting Python's Usability with C++'s Performance"
  description: |
    In many ways Python and C++ represent the two ends in the spectrum of
    programming languages. C++ has an important role in the field of computing
    as the language design principles promote efficiency, reliability and
    backward compatibility – a vital tripod for any long-lived codebase. Python
    has prioritized better usability and safety while making some tradeoffs on
    efficiency and backward compatibility. That has led developers to believe
    that there is a binary choice between performance and usability.

    Python has become the language of data science and machine learning in
    particular while C++ still is the language of voice for performance-critical
    software. The C++ and Python ecosystems are vast and achieving seamless
    interoperability between them is essential to avoid risky software rewrites.

    In this talk we leverage our decade-old experience in writing automatic
    Python to C++ bindings. We demonstrate how we could connect the Python
    interpreter to the new in-tree C++ interpreter called Clang-Repl. We show
    how we can build a uniform execution environment between both languages
    using the new compiler-as-a-service (CaaS) API available in Clang. The
    execution environment enables advanced interoperability such as the ability
    for Python to instantiate C++ templates on demand, inherit from C++ classes
    or catch std::exception. We show how CaaS can be connected to external
    services such as Jupyter and execute code written in both languages.

  description: |
    Built upon Clang and LLVM incremental compilation pipelines, Clang-Repl is
    a C++ interpreter featuring a REPL that enables C++ users to develop
    programs in an exploratory fashion. Autocompletion in Clang-Repl is a
    significant leap forward in this direction. The feature empowers Clang-Repl
    to accelerate their input and prevent typos. Inspired by the counterpart
    feature in Cling, a downstream project of Clang-Repl, our auto-completion
    feature leverages existing components of Clang/LLVM, and provides
    context-aware semantic completion suggestions. In this talk, we will present
    how autocompletion works at REPL and how it interacts with other Clang/LLVM
    infrastructure.

- title: "Automatic program reoptimization support in LLVM ORC JIT"
  description: |
    One of the prominent applications of the JIT compiler is the ability to
    compile “hot” functions utilizing various runtime profiling metrics gathered
    by slow versions of functions. The ORC API can be generalized further to
    make use of the profiling metrics and “reoptimize” the function hiding the
    reoptimization latency. For instance, one of the many applications of this
    technique is to compile functions at a lower optimization level for faster
    compilation speed and then reoptimize them to a higher level when those
    functions are frequently executed. This talk we demonstrate how we can
    express lazy JIT, speculative compilation, and re-optimization as "symbol
    redirection" problems. We demonstrate the improved ORC API for redirecting
    symbols. In addition, this technical talk will peek at internal details of
    how we implemented re-optimization support and showcase the demos such as
    real time clang-repl re-optimization from -O0 to -O3 or real time virtual
    call optimization through de-virtualization.

- title: "C++ as a service - rapid software development and dynamic interoperability with python and beyond"
  description: |
    The C++ programming language is used for many numerically intensive
    scientific applications. A combination of performance and solid backward
    compatibility has led to its use for many research software codes over the
    past 20 years. Despite its power, C++ is often seen as difficult to learn
    and inconsistent with rapid application development. Exploration and
    prototyping is slowed down by the long edit-compile-run cycles during
    development.

    In this talk we show how to leverage our experience in interactive C++,
    just-in-time compilation technology (JIT), dynamic optimizations, and large
    scale software development to greatly reduce the impedance mismatch between
    C++ and Python. We show how clang-repl generalizes Cling in LLVM upstream to
    offer a robust, sustainable and omnidisciplinary solution for C++ language
    interoperability. The demonstrate how we have:
      * advanced the interpretative technology to provide a state-of-the-art
        C++ execution environment;
      * enabled functionality which can provide native-like, dynamic runtime
        interoperability between C++ and Python; and
      * allowed utilization of heterogeneous hardware.

    The presentation includes interactive session where we demonstrate some of
    the capabilities of our system via the Jupyter interactive environment.

- title: "Efficient C++ Derivatives Through Source Transformation AD With Clad"
  description: |
    Clad enables automatic differentiation (AD) for C++. It is based on LLVM
    compiler infrastructure and is a plugin for Clang compiler. Clad is based
    on source code transformation. Given C++ source code of a mathematical
    function, it can automatically generate C++ code for computing derivatives
    of the function. Clad supports a large set of C++ features including control
    flow statements and function calls. It supports reverse-mode AD
    (a.k.a backpropagation) as well as forward-mode AD. It also facilitates
    computation of hessian matrix and jacobian matrix of any arbitrary function.

    In this talk we describe the programming model that Clad enables. We explain
    what are the benefits of using transformation-based automatic
    differentiation in high-performance static languages such as C++. We show
    examples of how to use the tool at scale.

    ACAT 2022 conference, we showcased more general benchmarks on the full
    minimization pipeline at CHEP 2023. In this workshop, we present how AD can
    be applied to production workflows in the field of HEP/NP. We also
    demonstrate that AD is the prime choice for workflows with many parameters,
    yielding lower minimization times and faster overall fit convergence due to
    lesser fit iterations and improved accuracy of the calculated gradients.

- title: "Automatic Interoperability Between C++ and Python"
  description: |
    The simplicity of Python and the power of C++ force stark choices on a
    scientific software stack. There have been multiple developments to mitigate
    language boundaries by implementing language bindings, but the impedance
    mismatch between the static nature of C++ and the dynamic one of Python
    hinders their implementation; examples include the use of user-defined
    Python types with templated C++ and advanced memory management.

    The development of the C++ interpreter Cling has changed the way we can
    think of language bindings as it provides an incremental compilation
    infrastructure available at runtime. That is, Python can interrogate C++ on
    demand, and bindings can be lazily constructed at runtime. This automatic
    binding provision requires no direct support from library authors and offers
    better performance than alternative solutions, such as PyBind11. ROOT
    pioneered this approach with PyROOT, which was later enhanced with its
    successor, cppyy. However, until now, cppyy relied on the reflection layer
    of ROOT, which is limited in terms of provided features and performance.

    The next step for language interoperability with cppyy, enabling research
    into uniform cross-language execution environments and boosting optimization
    opportunities across language boundaries. We illustrate the use of advanced
    C++ in Numba-accelerated Python through cppyy. We outline a path forward for
    re-engineering parts of cppyy to use upstream LLVM components to improve
    performance and sustainability. We demonstrate cppyy purely based on a C++
    reflection library, InterOp, which offers interoperability primitives based
    on Cling and Clang-Repl.

    Based on our recent publication: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02712

    We can share more details about the efforts done within the
    compiler-research project in the area of mixing python and C++ in a single
    jupyter notebook via technologies such as xeus-clang-repl.

    better use of the automatic gradient and extended the code generation with
    support for more RooFit models. In this workshop, we will present updated
    benchmarks where all numeric differentiation is avoided on the Minuit 2
    side, as well as new results with the RooFit AD backed applied to
    cutting-edge ATLAS Higgs analysis benchmarks for the first time.

    These results show that the RooFit AD backend is the prime choice for
    combined binned likelihoods with many parameters, yielding minimization
    times one order of magnitude below RooFits other backends and improving the
    fit convergence rate.

- title: "Fast And Automatic Floating Point Error Analysis With CHEF-FP"
  description: |
    As we reach the limit of Moore's Law, researchers are exploring different 
    paradigms to achieve unprecedented performance. Approximate Computing (AC), 
    which relies on the ability of applications to tolerate some error in the 
    results to trade-off accuracy for performance, has shown significant promise. 
    Despite the success of AC in domains such as Machine Learning, its acceptance 
    in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is limited due to its stringent 
    requirement of accuracy. We need tools and techniques to identify regions of 
    the code that are amenable to approximations and their impact on the 
    application output quality so as to guide developers to employ selective 
    approximation. To this end, we propose CHEF-FP, a flexible, scalable, and 
    easy-to-use source-code transformation tool based on Automatic 
    Differentiation (AD) for analysing approximation errors in HPC applications.
    
    CHEF-FP uses Clad,  an efficient AD tool built as a plugin to the Clang 
    compiler and based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure, as a backend and 
    utilizes its AD abilities to evaluate approximation errors in C++ code. 
    CHEF-FP works at the source level by injecting error estimation code 
    into the generated adjoints. This enables the error-estimation code to 
    undergo compiler optimizations resulting in improved analysis time and 
    reduced memory usage. We also provide theoretical and architectural 
    augmentations to source code transformation-based AD tools to perform FP 
    error analysis.
    
    In this talk, we primarily focus on analyzing errors introduced by 
    mixed-precision AC techniques, the most popular approximate technique in HPC. 
    We also show the applicability of our tool in estimating other kinds of 
    errors by evaluating our tool on codes that use approximate functions. 
    Moreover, we demonstrate the speedups achieved by CHEF-FP during analysis 
    time as compared to the existing state-of-the-art tool as a result of its 
    ability to generate and insert approximation error estimate code directly 
    into the derivative source. The generated code also becomes a candidate for 
    better compiler optimizations contributing to lesser runtime performance 
    overhead.

- title: "Making Likelihood Calculations Fast: Automatic Differentiation Applied to RooFit"
  description: |
    With the growing datasets of current and next-generation High-Energy and
    Nuclear Physics (HEP/NP) experiments, statistical analysis has become more
    computationally demanding. These increasing demands elicit improvements and
    modernizations in existing statistical analysis software. One way to address
    these issues is to improve parameter estimation performance and numeric
    stability using automatic differentiation (AD). AD's computational efficiency
    and accuracy is superior to the preexisting numerical differentiation
    techniques and offers significant performance gains when calculating the
    derivatives of functions with a large number of inputs, making it particularly
    appealing for statistical models with many parameters. For such models,
    many HEP/NP experiments use RooFit, a toolkit for statistical modeling and
    fitting that is part of ROOT.

    In this talk, we report on the effort to support the AD of RooFit likelihood
    functions. Our approach is to extend RooFit with a tool that generates
    overhead-free C++ code for a full likelihood function built from RooFit
    functional models. Gradients are then generated using Clad, a compiler-based
    source-code-transformation AD tool, using this C++ code. We present our results
    from applying AD to the entire minimization pipeline and profile likelihood
    calculations of several RooFit and HistFactory models at the LHC-experiment
    scale. We show significant reductions in calculation time and memory usage
    for the minimization of such likelihood functions. We also elaborate on
    this approach's current limitations and explain our plans for the future.

- title: "Using C++ From Numba, Fast and Automatic"
  description: |
    The scientific community using Python has developed several ways to
    accelerate Python codes. One popular technology is Numba, a Just-in-time
    (JIT) compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast
    machine code using LLVM. We have extended Numba's integration with LLVM's
    intermediate representation (IR) to enable the use of C++ kernels and
    connect them to Numba accelerated codes. Such a multilanguage setup is also
    commonly used to achieve performance or to interface with external
    bare-metal libraries. In addition, Numba users will be able to write the
    performance-critical codes in C++ and use them easily at native speed.

    This work relies on high-performance, dynamic, bindings between Python and
    C++. Cppyy, which is the basis of PyROOT's interfaces to C++ libraries.
    Cppyy uses Cling, an incremental C++ interpreter, to generate on-demand
    bindings of required entities and connect them with the Python interpreter.
    This environment is uniquely positioned to enable the use of C++ from Numba
    in a fast and automatic way.

    In this talk, we demonstrate using C++ from Numba through Cppyy. We show
    our approach which extends Cppyy to match the object typing and lowering
    models of Numba and the necessary additions to the reflection layers to
    generate IR from Python objects. The uniform LLVM runtime allows
    optimizations such as inlining which can in the future remove the C++
    function call overhead. We discuss other optimizations such as lazily
    instantiated C++ templates based on input data. The talk also briefly
    outlines the non-negligible, Numba-introduced JIT overhead and possible
    ways to optimize it. Since this is built as a Cppyy extension Numba
    supports all bindings automatically without any user intervention.

- title: "Automatic Differentiation of Binned Likelihoods With RooFit and Clad"
  description: |
    RooFit is a toolkit for statistical modeling and fitting used by most
    experiments in particle physics. Just as data sets from next-generation
    experiments grow, processing requirements for physics analysis become more
    computationally demanding, necessitating performance optimizations for
    RooFit. One possibility to speed-up minimization and add stability is the
    use of automatic differentiation (AD). Unlike for numerical differentiation,
    the computation cost scales linearly with the number of parameters, making AD
    particularly appealing for statistical models with many parameters. In this
    talk, we report on one possible way to implement AD in RooFit. Our approach
    is to add a facility to generate C++ code for a full RooFit model automatically.
    Unlike the original RooFit model, this generated code is free of virtual
    function calls and other RooFit-specific overhead. In particular, this code
    is then used to produce the gradient automatically with Clad. Clad is a source
    transformation AD tool implemented as a plugin to the clang compiler, which
    automatically generates the derivative code for input C++ functions. We show
    results demonstrating the improvements observed when applying this code
    generation strategy to HistFactory and other commonly used RooFit models.

    HistFactory is the subcomponent of RooFit that implements binned likelihood
    models with probability densities based on histogram templates. These models
    frequently have a very large number of free parameters, and are thus an
    interesting first target for AD support in RooFit.

  description: |
    Automatic Differentiation is a powerful technique to evaluate the derivative of
    a function specified by a computer program. Thanks to the ROOT interpreter, Cling,
    this technique is available in ROOT for computing gradients and Hessian matrices of
    multi-dimensional functions. We will present the current integration of this tool
    in the ROOT Mathematical libraries for computing gradients of functions that can
    then be used in numerical algorithms. For example, we demonstrate the correctness
    and performance improvements in ROOT’s fitting algorithms. We will show also how

- title: "Estimating Floating-Point Errors Using Automatic Differentiation"
  description: |
    Floating-point errors are a testament to the finite nature of computing
    and if left uncontrolled they can have catastrophic results. As such, for
    high-precision computing applications, quantifying these uncertainties
    becomes imperative. There have been significant efforts to mitigate such
    errors by either extending the underlying floating-point precision, using
    alternate compensation algorithms or estimating them using a variety of
    statistical and non-statistical methods. A prominent method of dynamic
    floating-point error estimation is using Automatic Differentiation (AD).
    However, most state-of-the-art AD-based estimation software requires
    manually adapting or annotating the source code by some amount. Moreover,
    operator overloading AD based error estimation tools call for multiple
    gradient recomputations to report errors over a large variety of inputs
    and suffer from all the shortcomings of the underlying operator
    overloading strategy such as reduced efficiency. In this work, we propose
    a customizable way to use AD to synthesize source code for estimating
    uncertainties arising from floating-point arithmetic in C/C++ applications.

    Our work presents an automatic error annotation framework that can be used
    in conjunction with custom user defined error models. We also present our
    progress with error estimation on GPU applications.

- title: "GPU Acceleration of Automatic Differentiation in C++ with Clad"
  description: |
    Automatic Differentiation (AD) is instrumental for science and industry. It
    is a tool to evaluate the derivative of a function specified through a
    computer program. The range of AD application domain spans from Machine
    Learning to Robotics to High Energy Physics. Computing gradients with the
    help of AD is guaranteed to be more precise than the numerical alternative
    and have at most a constant factor (4) more arithmetical operations compared
    to the original function. Moreover, AD applications to domain problems
    typically are computationally bound. They are often limited by the
    computational requirements of high-dimensional transformation parameters and
    thus can greatly benefit from parallel implementations on graphics
    processing units (GPUs).

    Clad aims to enable differentiable analysis for C/C++ and CUDA and is a
    compiler-assisted AD tool available both as a compiler extension and in
    ROOT. Moreover, Clad works as a compiler plugin extending the Clang
    compiler; as a plugin extending the interactive interpreter Cling; and as
    a Jupyter kernel extension based on xeus-cling.

    In this talk, we demonstrate the advantages of parallel gradient
    computations on graphics processing units (GPUs) with Clad. We explain how
    to bring forth a new layer of optimisation and a proportional speed up by
    extending the usage of Clad for CUDA. The gradients of well-behaved C++
    functions can be automatically executed on a GPU. Thus, across the spectrum
    of fields, researchers can reuse their existing models and have workloads
    scheduled on parallel processors without the need to optimize their
    computational kernels. The library can be easily integrated into existing
    frameworks or used interactively, and provides optimal performance.
    Furthermore, we demonstrate the achieved application performance
    improvements, including (~10x) in ROOT histogram fitting and corresponding
    performance gains from offloading to GPUs.

- title: "Enabling Interactive C++ with Clang"
  description: |
    The design of LLVM and Clang enables them to be used as libraries, and has
    led to the creation of an entire compiler-assisted ecosystem of tools. The
    relatively friendly codebase of Clang and advancements in the JIT
    infrastructure in LLVM further enable research into different methods for
    processing C++ by blurring the boundary between compile time and runtime.
    Challenges include incremental compilation and fitting compile/link time
    optimizations into a more dynamic environment.

    Incremental compilation pipelines process code chunk-by-chunk by building an
    ever-growing translation unit. Code is then lowered into the LLVM IR and
    subsequently run by the LLVM JIT. Such a pipeline allows creation of
    efficient interpreters. The interpreter enables interactive exploration and
    makes the C++ language more user friendly. The incremental compilation mode
    is used by the interactive C++ interpreter, Cling, initially developed to
    enable interactive high-energy physics analysis in a C++ environment. Cling
    is now used for interactive development in Jupyter Notebooks
    (via xeus-cling), dynamic python bindings (via cppyy) and interactive CUDA
    development.

    In this talk we dive into the details of implementing incremental
    compilation with Clang. We outline a path forward for `Clang-Repl` which is
    built with the experience gained in Cling and is now available in mainstream
    llvm. We describe how the new Orc JIT infrastructure allows us to naturally
    perform static optimizations at runtime, and enables linker voodoo to make
    the compiler/interpreter boundaries disappear. We explain the potential of
    having a compiler-as-a-service architecture in the context of automatic
    language interoperability for Python and beyond.

- title: "Enabling Interactive C++ with Clang"
  description: |
    Clad enables automatic differentiation (AD) for C++ algorithms through
    source-to-source transformation. It is based on LLVM compiler infrastructure
    and as a Clang compiler plugin. Different from other tools, Clad manipulates
    the high-level code representation (the AST) rather than implementing its
    own C++ parser and does not require modifications to existing code bases.
    This methodology is both easier to adopt and potentially more performant
    than other approaches. Having full access to the Clang compiler's internals
    means that Clad is able to follow the high-level semantics of algorithms and
    can perform domain-specific optimisations; automatically generate code
    (re-targeting C++) on accelerator hardware with appropriate scheduling;
    and has a direct connection to compiler diagnostics engine and thus
    producing precise and expressive diagnostics positioned at desired source
    locations.

    In this talk, we showcase the above mentioned advantages through examples
    and outline Clad's features, applications and support extensions. We
    describe the challenges coming from supporting automatic differentiation of
    broader C++ and present how Clad can compute derivatives of functions,
    member functions, functors and lambda expressions. We show the newly added
    support of array differentiation which provides the basis utility for CUDA
    support and parallelisation of gradient computation. Moreover, we will demo
    different interactive use-cases of Clad, either within a Jupyter environment
    as a kernel extension based on xeus-cling or within a gpu-cpu environment
    where the gradient computation can be accelerated through gpu-code produced
    by Clad and run with the help of the Cling interpreter.

- title: "Interactive C++ for Data Science"
  description: |
    C++ is used for many numerically intensive applications. A combination of
    performance and solid backward compatibility has led to its use for many
    research software codes over the past 20 years. Despite its power, C++ is
    often seen as difficult to learn and not well suited with rapid application
    development. The long edit-compile-run cycle is a large impediment to
    exploration and prototyping during development.

    Cling has emerged as a recognized capability that enables interactivity,
    dynamic interoperability and rapid prototyping capabilities for C++
    developers. Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of the
    Clang and LLVM compiler infrastructure. The interpreter enables interactive
    exploration and makes the C++ language more welcoming for research. Cling
    supports the full C++ feature set including the use of templates, lambdas,
    and virtual inheritance.Cling’s field of origin is the field of high energy
    physics where it facilitates the processing of scientific data. The
    interpreter was an essential part of the software tools of the LHC
    experimental program and was part of the software used to detect the
    gravitational waves of the LIGO experiment. Interactive C++ has proven to be
    useful for other communities. The Cling ecosystem includes dynamic bindings
    tools to languages including python, D and Julia (cppyy); C++ in Jupyter
    Notebooks (xeus-cling); interactive CUDA; and automatic differentiation on
    the fly (clad).

    This talk outlines key properties of interactive C++ such as execution
    results, entity redefinition, error recovery and code undo. It demonstrates
    the capability enabled by an interactive C++ platform in the context of data
    science. For example, the use of eval-style programming, C++ in Jupyter
    notebooks and CUDA C++. We talk about design and implementation challenges
    and go beyond just interpreting C++. We showcase template instantiation on
    demand, language interoperability on demand and bridging compiled and
    interpreted code. We show how to easily build new capabilities using the
    Cling infrastructure through developing an automatic differentiation plugin
    for C++ and CUDA.

- title: "Differentiable Programming in C++"
  description: |
    Mathematical derivatives are vital components of many computing algorithms
    including: neural networks, numerical optimization, Bayesian inference,
    nonlinear equation solvers, physics simulations, sensitivity analysis, and
    nonlinear inverse problems. Derivatives track the rate of change of an
    output parameter with respect to an input parameter, such as how much
    reducing an individuals’ carbon footprint will impact the Earth’s
    temperature. Derivatives (and generalizations such as gradients, jacobians,
    hessians, etc) allow us to explore the properties of a function and better
    describe the underlying process as a whole. In recent years, the use of
    gradient-based optimizations such as training neural networks have become
    widespread, leading to many languages making differentiation a first-class
    citizen.

    Derivatives can be computed numerically, but unfortunately the accumulation
    of floating-point errors and high-computational complexity presents several
    challenges. These problems become worse with higher order derivatives and
    more parameters to differentiate.

    Many derivative-based algorithms require gradients, or the computation of
    the derivative of an output parameter with respect to many input parameters.
    As such, developing techniques for computing gradients that are scalable in
    the number of input parameters is crucial for the performance of such
    algorithms. This paper describes a broad set of domains where scalable
    derivative computations are essential. We make an overview of the major
    techniques in computing derivatives, and finally, we introduce the flagman
    of computational differential calculus -- algorithmic (also known as
    automatic) differentiation (AD). AD makes clever use of the ‘nice’
    mathematical properties of the chained rule and generative programming to
    solve the scalability issues by inverting the dependence on the number of
    input variables to the number of output variables. AD provides mechanisms to
    augment the regular function computation with instructions calculating its
    derivatives.

    Differentiable programming is a programming paradigm in which the programs
    can be differentiated throughout, usually via automatic differentiation.
    This talk introduces the differentiable programming paradigm in terms of
    C++. It shows its applications in science as applicable for data science
    and industry. The authors make an overview of the existing tools in the area
    and the two common implementation approaches -- template metaprogramming and
    custom parsers. We demonstrate implementation pros and cons and propose
    compiler toolchain-based implementation either in clang AST or LLVM IR. We
    would like to briefly outline our current efforts in standardization of that
    feature.
